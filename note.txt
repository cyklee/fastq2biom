Thoughts on converting usearch to vsearch (open source)

As a review of the uparse pipeline
pair reads
filter (using max expected error)
dereplicate
sort and discard singletons
-clusterotus (UPARSE clustering and chimera checking)
uchime ref
remap reads to make abundance table

What I do with vsearch:
pair reads (with qiime using ea-utils)
filter (with qiime)
dereplicate 
sort and discard singletons
-cluster_fast (uclust clustering)
uchime denovo
uchime ref
remap reads to make abundance table
